	          	In a time of global crisis, an international task force of heroes banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world: OVERWATCH.
							</p>
							<p>
	          	Overwatch ended the crisis, and helped maintain peace in the decades that followed, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. But, after many years, Overwatch's influence waned, and it was eventually disbanded.
							</p>
							<p>
	          	Now, conflict is rising across the world again, and the call has gone out to heroes old and new. Are you with us?

If your team is on defense and your first goal is to hold an objective, you may want more defense heroes like Junkrat and Bastion</p><p>As the tactical situation changes during a match, you may find that you’d like to change the hero you're playing. It’s easy; in your team's starting area, press (PC: H; PS4: Hold Square; XB1: Hold X) and select your new hero. Just remember that your ultimate ability's charge level will be reset!</p></td>
									<td><p>The amount of damage a hero can take before dying is represented by their Health . Health can be recovered by collecting health packs, found in fixed locations throughout each map, or by certain heroe' abilities (especially Support heroes). When a hero's Health is reduced to zero, they die, but they'll return (“respawn”) shortly. While you wait for a dead teammate to respawn, your team is at a disadvantage. Try your best to keep them (and yourself) alive!</p><p>In addition to Health, heroes can receive boosts to their survivability in the form of shields and armor, which absorb damage before Health.

							<h5>1. Point Capture (Assault) Maps</h5>
							<p>
	          	On Point Capture maps, each team will play a game on Attack. Each captured point counts as one score point. At the end of the two games, the team with the most points wins. For example, if team 1 had captures both points A and B, the score at the end of the game will be 2:0. If team 2 then only manages to capture point A, the final score will be 2:1 in favour of team 1, who will win the match immediately. It is worth noting that if team 1 fails to capture any points during their attack, the match will end as soon as team 2 captures the first point.
							</p>
							<h5>2. Payload (Escort) Maps</h5>
							<p>
								On Payload maps, each team will play a game on Attack. Each checkpoint that the payload moves through counts as one score point. At the end of the two games, the team with the most points wins. For example, if team 1 had pushed the payload to the end (through 3 checkpoints), the score at the end of that game would be 3:0. If team 2 then only manages to push the payload past 2 checkpoints, the final score would be 3:2 in favour of team 1, who will win the match immediately
							</p>
							<h5>3. Hybrid Maps</h5>
							<p>
	          	On Hybrid maps, the system works very similarly to Payload maps. The first point counts as a single score point, and if neither team manages to capture it (meaning that they do not start moving the payload), then the game goes into Sudden Death (explained below).
							</p>
							<h5>4. Sudden Death</h5>
							<p>
	          	In Sudden Death, a coin flip determines which of the two teams attacks and which defends. Then, the attacking team is given a set amount of time (listed below) in which to capture the first point of the map, or reach the first checkpoint (in the case of Payload maps). If they succeed in doing this, then they win the match. If they fail, then the defending team wins the match.
